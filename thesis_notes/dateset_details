Preprocessing

- removed duplicated content(replicated), kept the first appearance
- removed content with less then 50 characters
- the filtered lemmas do not contain stopwords, ADP(prepositions), CCONJ(conjunctions), SCONJ(conjunctions)

Questions:
- what can I do with duplicated lemmas in the RoEmoLex that have a different POS? (I kept the first appearance)
- emotions scores are not normalized, should I normalize them?
- each emotion score is calculated by adding all the scores of that emotion and dividing by the total number of samples in that category
- should I include emotion density(proportion of emotional language) also? for now we have emotion signal
- look why the visualizations show such small graph for satire and real news. is it just the formula?
